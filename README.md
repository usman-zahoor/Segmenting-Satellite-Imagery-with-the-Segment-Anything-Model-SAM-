# Segmenting-Satellite-Imagery-with-the-Segment-Anything-Model-SAM

## Introduction
This notebook demonstrates how to perform object segmentation from images using the High-Quality Segment Anything Model (HQ-SAM), a state-of-the-art deep learning model designed for accurate and flexible image segmentation tasks. With just a few lines of code, you can extract specific objects from any image using the HQ-SAM framework.

###  Object Segmentation
Object segmentation is a computer vision technique that involves classifying every pixel in an image as belonging to either a specific object or the background. The goal is to isolate objects of interest within the image and assign each pixel to a label corresponding to that object.


### Key Features
**Advanced Segmentation:** HQ-SAM can handle both small and large objects with a high degree of accuracy.  
**Easy Integration:** The model is easy to integrate into existing workflows, with support for various image formats.  
**Minimal Code:** The notebook demonstrates how to perform segmentation with minimal code, making it quick and easy to get started.

### Automatic mask generation options
There are several tunable parameters in automatic mask generation that control how densely points are sampled and what the thresholds are for removing low quality or duplicate masks. Additionally, generation can be automatically run on crops of the image to get improved performance on smaller objects, and post-processing can remove stray pixels and holes.

### Conclusion
This notebook provides a simple and efficient way to perform high-quality object segmentation using the HQ-SAM model. With its minimal code and powerful results, it serves as an excellent tool for computer vision tasks that require object segmentation.
